# Unit 20: Deliverable One- Grading Rubric 
## Presentation
Topic Selected: Stroke prediction using various health and lifestyle metrics. It is important to understand and assess the risk of suffering from a stroke and the purpose of this investigation is to apply different machine learning models to empower people with information. 
The dataset was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset. The dataset includes eleven different features regarding health and lifestyle. The goal is to determine if there is a way to determine a patientâ€™s risk for stroke based on the eleven features.
## GitHub
Communication protocols: The group is using Slack to communicate what we have worked on and what we are planning on working on. The group has also communicated when we will be unavailable to work on the group project.
## Machine Learning Model
Code has been written to apply a k-Means clustering model.
## Database 
Original database has been prepared for use in machine learning models. The new, cleaned database is available under the resources folder and has been introduced to the notebook containing the start of the machine learning code.
