# Overview of the Analysis
# Topic Selected
 The goal of this analysis is to put together a stroke prediction model using various health and lifestyle metrics. It is important to understand and assess the risk of suffering from a stroke and the purpose of this investigation is to apply different machine learning models to empower people with information.
## Questions to be Addressed: 
- Which learning model work best with our dataset
- Which features influence the model the most?
- What metrics best determine stroke risk.
# Dataset
The dataset was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset. The dataset includes eleven different features regarding health and lifestyle. The goal is to determine if there is a way to determine a patientâ€™s risk for stroke based on the eleven features.
# Results/ Visualization 
TBD
